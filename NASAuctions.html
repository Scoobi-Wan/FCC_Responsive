    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="aboutP">We were created in 2005 as a way to provide additional funding to the NASA program, while also repurposing used equipment and putting it into the hands of the spacefaring American people. Every one of our products passes a 6,784 point strict inspection to make sure that everything is in working order, and thanks to our partnership with Amazon, we now offer <strong>FREE</strong> two day prime shipping. No refunds tho sorry.
